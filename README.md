# Astrodynamics-UG-course

Assignments (with solutions) for undergraduate orbital mechanics course. I was a teaching assistant for this fundamental course on astrodynamics at Aerospace Engg., Texas A&M. I have designed these assignments in the spirit of covering fundamental concepts in theory and application (programming) at undergraduate level. 

I also mentored three mission design honors projects for this class. Project statements will be shared upon request. 

# Topics

1. Coordinate transformations, linear algebra
2. Two body problem
3. Launch to rendezvous, orbit transfers
4. Interplanetary transfers, gravity assist missions
5. Relative motion
6. three-body problem
7. Orbit perturbations, perigee and RAAN maintenance
8. Attitude determination
