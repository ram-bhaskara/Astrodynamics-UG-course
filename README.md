# Astrodynamics-UG-course

Assignments (with solutions) for undergraduate orbital mechanics course. I was a teaching assistant for this fundamental course on astrodynamics at Aerospace Engg., Texas A&M. I have designed these assignments in the spirit of covering fundamental concepts in theory and application (programming) at undergraduate level. 

I also mentored two mission design honors projects for this class. Project statements included 
1. Interplanetary Hohmann transfer to Mars using lunar gravity assist, 
2. Mission to Jupiter from LEO with gravity assist from Mars.

Mission design is analyzed using analytical approaches and the [NASA GMAT tool](https://software.nasa.gov/software/GSC-17177-1).
