# Astrodynamics-UG-course

Assignments (with solutions) for undergraduate orbital mechanics course. I was a teaching assistant for this course on Orbital Mechanics at Aerospace Engg., Texas A&M. I have designed these assignments to cover a few fundamental concepts in theory and application (programming) on topics related to astrodynamics. 

Reference: Orbital mechanics for engineering students, H. Curtis 

I also mentored two mission design honors projects for this class. Project statements included 
1. Interplanetary Hohmann transfer to Mars using lunar gravity assist, 
2. Mission to Jupiter from LEO with gravity assist from Mars.

Mission design is analyzed using analytical approaches and the [NASA GMAT tool](https://software.nasa.gov/software/GSC-17177-1) and Ansys STK.
